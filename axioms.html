        <h1>Axioms of Etherware Cloud</h1>

        <p>
          Axioms define the minimal, non-negotiable constraints of Etherware
          Cloud. They are not implementation details, recommendations, or best
          practices.
        </p>

        <p>
          Axioms do not describe how EC is implemented, but what must remain
          true for something to be considered part of Etherware Cloud.
        </p>

        <section>
          <h2>Axiom 1 — Everything is a Message</h2>

          <p>All interactions in Etherware Cloud are expressed as messages.</p>

          <p>
            Code, configuration, failures, deployments, and results are all
            represented as messages.
          </p>

          <!-- TODO: Discuss whether metadata and control signals are messages or message attributes -->
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Axiom 2 — Messages Exist Independently of Executors</h2>

          <p>Messages are not owned by executors.</p>

          <p>
            An executor may consume, transform, or emit messages, but the
            message itself exists independently of its implementation.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Axiom 3 — Executors Are Replaceable</h2>

          <p>
            Any executor may be replaced without altering the system, as long as
            it respects the message contract.
          </p>

          <p>
            Executors may be written in any language or implemented as AI
            systems, expert systems, or hybrid models.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Axiom 4 — Failure Is a Message</h2>

          <p>Failures are first-class messages.</p>

          <p>
            Errors do not break the model and do not require exceptional
            handling outside the message system.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Axiom 5 — Time Is Part of the Message</h2>

          <p>Messages exist in time.</p>

          <p>
            Ordering, replay, delay, and historical inspection are intrinsic
            properties of the system.
          </p>

          <!-- TODO: Define whether time must be explicit in every message or derivable from context -->
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Axiom 6 — Transparency Is Selective</h2>

          <p>Etherware Cloud does not require full transparency.</p>

          <p>
            Visibility of messages is selective, controlled, and contextual.
          </p>

          <p>Lack of visibility does not negate the existence of a message.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Axiom 7 — Contracts Are Stronger Than Code</h2>

          <p>
            Message contracts define system behavior more strongly than code
            implementations.
          </p>

          <p>
            Breaking a contract is a semantic rupture, not an implementation
            detail.
          </p>

          <!-- TODO: Discuss how strict contract validation should be at runtime -->
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Axiom 8 — Evolution Includes Rupture</h2>

          <p>Etherware Cloud allows and expects breaking changes.</p>

          <p>Compatibility is optional and contextual.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Axiom 9 — Divergence Is Valid</h2>

          <p>
            Multiple incompatible ideas, implementations, or networks may
            coexist within the EC ecosystem.
          </p>

          <p>Convergence is emergent, not enforced.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Axiom 10 — Use Implies Responsibility</h2>

          <p>Using an idea or implementation implies accepting its risks.</p>

          <p>
            Etherware Cloud provides no implicit guarantees of safety,
            correctness, or stability.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Axiom 11 — Creation Has Cost</h2>

          <p>Every transformation embodies human effort and cognitive cost.</p>

          <p>
            Etherware Cloud acknowledges that creation is not free, even when
            code is open.
          </p>

          <!-- TODO: Formalize how creation cost is represented or accounted for -->
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Axiom 12 — Authorship Is Preserved</h2>

          <p>
            Authorship of ideas and transformations is preserved regardless of
            reuse, obsolescence, or replacement.
          </p>

          <p>Replacement does not erase origin.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Axiom 13 — Canon Emerges From Use</h2>

          <p>Nothing is canonical by declaration.</p>

          <p>
            Canonical status emerges from effective use, not consensus or
            authority.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Closing Note</h2>

          <p>Axioms may evolve, but only through explicit revision.</p>

          <p>Until revised, they define the boundary of Etherware Cloud.</p>
