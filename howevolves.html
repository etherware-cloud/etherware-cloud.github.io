        <h1>How Etherware Cloud Evolves</h1>

        <p>
          Etherware Cloud does not evolve through consensus, voting, or linear
          roadmaps. It evolves through the explicit interaction of ideas,
          experiments, failures, ruptures, and messages.
        </p>

        <p>
          This document describes the evolutionary model of EC: how ideas enter
          the system, how they change, how they break, and how they are
          replaced.
        </p>

        <section>
          <h2>1. From Idea to Documentation</h2>

          <p>
            Any idea may enter Etherware Cloud through documentation.
            Documentation is sufficient to make an idea visible and discussable.
          </p>

          <p>
            There is no requirement for implementation, validation, or approval
            at this stage. Ideas are not filtered by popularity or feasibility,
            but by clarity.
          </p>

          <p>
            Axioms act as constraints, not as gatekeepers. An idea may violate
            current axioms and still be documented, as long as the violation is
            explicit.
          </p>

          <!-- TODO: Discuss whether documentation should follow a minimal template -->
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>2. From Documentation to Experiment</h2>

          <p>
            An idea becomes an experiment when someone decides to explore it
            operationally.
          </p>

          <p>
            This transition does not require formal approval. It requires intent
            and responsibility.
          </p>

          <p>
            Experiments may fail, stall, or be abandoned without invalidating
            the original idea.
          </p>

          <!-- TODO: Define optional metadata for experiments (status, scope, owner) -->
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>3. Divergence Instead of Resolution</h2>

          <p>
            When ideas are incompatible, Etherware Cloud does not force
            resolution.
          </p>

          <p>
            Incompatibility is treated as information. Divergent paths are
            allowed to coexist and evolve independently.
          </p>

          <p>
            Convergence may occur naturally through demonstrated efficiency or
            clarity, but it is never imposed.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>4. Evolution Requires Rupture</h2>

          <p>
            Evolution in EC implies rupture. Breaking compatibility is allowed
            and expected.
          </p>

          <p>
            Ruptures should be explicit. Silent breakage increases systemic cost
            and reduces understanding.
          </p>

          <p>
            Explaining a rupture is not mandatory, but it is necessary for the
            health of the ecosystem.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>5. Obsolescence Is Explicit and Reversible</h2>

          <p>
            Ideas, documents, and implementations may become obsolete.
            Obsolescence must be declared explicitly.
          </p>

          <p>
            An obsolete idea is not invalidated. It may be revisited, restored,
            or reimplemented in a new context.
          </p>

          <p>Obsolescence preserves authorship and historical traceability.</p>

          <!-- TODO: Discuss whether obsolescence states should be standardized -->
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>6. Multiple EC Networks</h2>

          <p>Etherware Cloud does not assume a single global network.</p>

          <p>
            Multiple EC networks may exist, each with distinct axioms,
            implementations, and economies.
          </p>

          <p>
            Fragmentation is expected during exploration phases and is not
            considered a failure.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>7. Interoperability and Coupling</h2>

          <p>Interoperability between EC networks is optional.</p>

          <p>
            When chosen, coupling should be explicit, limited, and reversible.
            It may occur at the level of messages, contracts, or results.
          </p>

          <p>
            Incompatibilities are recommended to be documented to reduce
            integration ambiguity and future cost.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>8. Messages as the Unit of Truth</h2>

          <p>In Etherware Cloud, messages are the primary carriers of truth.</p>

          <p>
            Code, executors, and runtimes are replaceable. Messages persist.
          </p>

          <p>
            Failures are messages. Time is part of the data. Re-execution and
            redirection are first-class operations.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>9. Replacement Without Permission</h2>

          <p>
            Any executor, implementation, or transformation may be replaced
            without authorization.
          </p>

          <p>
            Replacement is validated through operation, not through agreement.
          </p>

          <p>Respecting message contracts is the only requirement.</p>

          <!-- TODO: Clarify how competing executors are evaluated in practice -->
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>10. Use of Artificial Intelligence</h2>

          <p>The use of AI is encouraged in all stages of EC evolution.</p>

          <p>
            AI may be used to generate ideas, improve clarity, validate
            technical claims, translate documents, or act as an executor.
          </p>

          <p>
            Using AI to harden ideas against false claims or implicit
            assumptions is considered good practice.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Closing Note</h2>

          <p>
            Etherware Cloud evolves through explicit action, visible cost, and
            replaceable structures.
          </p>

          <p>Nothing is permanent. Nothing is hidden. What works survives.</p>
